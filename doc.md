### INCR Load
- Loads only new/changed data
- Uses watermark logic
- Improves performance

---

## Control Flow Logic
IF p_load_type = FULL → Full pipeline execution
ELSE IF p_load_type = INCR → Incremental pipeline execution
ELSE → Fail pipeline


---

## Monitoring & Logging

- Activity-level logging:
  - meta.pipeline_activity_audit
- Run-level logging:
  - meta.pipeline_run_audit

---

## Failure Handling

- Centralized failure handling using a single Fail activity
- All notebook failures route to fail_pipeline_execution
- Ensures consistent pipeline termination

---

## Testing Types

### 1. Pipeline Execution Testing

Validates that the pipeline executes correctly under different scenarios.

---

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1 — FULL Load

**Input:**
p_load_type = FULL

**Expected Behavior:**

* FULL branch executes
* All notebooks run sequentially:

  * Bronze → Silver → Gold → Optimize → DQ
* Pipeline completes successfully

---

### Scenario 2 — INCR Load

**Input:**
p_load_type = INCR

**Expected Behavior:**

* INCR branch executes
* Incremental logic is applied
* Only new/updated data is processed
* Pipeline completes successfully

---

### Scenario 3 — INVALID Load Type

**Input:**
p_load_type = XYZ

**Expected Behavior:**

* Neither the FULL nor the INCR branch executes
* Fail activity triggers
* Pipeline status = Failed
* Error message = INVALID_LOAD_TYPE

---

### Scenario 4 — Failure Simulation

**Test Method:**
Introduce a temporary error in a notebook:

```python
raise Exception("Test Failure")
```

**Expected Behavior:**

* Pipeline stops immediately
* fail_pipeline_execution activity triggers
* Pipeline status = Failed

---

## Data Validation Testing

### Bronze Layer

* Validate row count matches source
* Ensure metadata columns are populated

### Silver Layer

* Validate valid vs rejected records
* Ensure data standardization is correct
* Verify watermark logic

### Gold Layer

* Validate dimension and fact tables
* Verify SCD Type 2 behavior
* Check aggregation tables

---

## Data Quality Testing

Performed in nb_05_data_quality_checks

### Checks Included:

* NULL key validation
* Duplicate transaction detection
* Fraud KPI validation

### Expected Behavior:

* Pipeline fails if critical DQ issues are found

---

## Audit Logging Validation

Validate records in:

* meta.pipeline_activity_audit
* meta.pipeline_run_audit

### Expected:

* One record per notebook per pipeline run
* Correct status (SUCCESS / FAILED)
* Accurate duration and timestamps

---

## Testing Best Practices

* Test one scenario at a time
* Do not mix FULL and INCR runs
* Remove all test code after validation
* Capture test results for documentation
* Validate both success and failure paths

---

## Outcome

This testing strategy ensures:
